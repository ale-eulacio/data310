Misinformation on the internet has always been rampant, and the pandemic has caused an extrodinary amount of misinformation to pervade the internet. Last semester, I conducted some research that involved conspiracy theories related to covid, and we found that confirmation bias is significantly related to conspiracy theory ideation. Confirmation bias is the seeking out of information that confirms your previous beliefs or biases. With Covid especially, it is easy for many people to gravitate towards information that confirms their bias of not wanting the pandemic to happen. With this project, I plan to seek out information on r/VaccineMyths, a reddit dedicated to vaccine myths (with proponents of both sides, pro or against vaccines), that could inform as to what type of words are used when talking about these myths. I think the best way to approach this topic is to possibly identify three levels of intensity for these posts of Vaccine Myths. To do this, I will conduct a RNN text classifaction that tensorflow offers. I plan on using this website as a resource: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/text_classification_rnn.
With this project, I mostly want to learn if there are any patterns in word use when talking about misinformation on the internet. Even developing a recognition of these patterns would be beneficial for social media platforms who monitor misinformation. Identifying varying levels of "intensity" with these posts and comments is more of a stretch goal.
