I found this cool image on the architecture section of unsplash. I wanted to see what the vertical and horizontal line filters could do with it since it has so many lines that are going in a circle. I modififed the horizontal and vertical line filters slightly, just adding bigger numbers to see what that would do.
Filter 1 = filter = [ [-2, -3, -2], [0, 0, 0], [2, 3, 2]]
The result was about the same as the original vertical line filter. The only difference is that the whites were accented more with the filter with slightly bigger numers
